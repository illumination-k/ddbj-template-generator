# Biosample generator

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to provide appropriate schemas for Biosample data on a method and species
basis, as well as generate TSV files for submission that reflect input results based on those schemas, for
registration in NCBI/DDBJ.

## Simplify data collection and analysis

Schemas for each species are defined in JSON format on GitHub and new schemas can be defined via Pull
Requests. This project is expected to simplify text mining and the construction of secondary databases based
on species and method.

## How to define Schema?
